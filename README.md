# Hotel-pricing-strategy

The dataset reports the rent price of Hotel rooms across 42 different cities and I tried to identify the factors responsible for an increase in room rent. I was aware that the Star Rating does positive influence the price of any Hotel. So, it shall be a part of our final model. To identify remaining factors, I looked at 3 different Hypothesis such as:
H1 – The Hotel prices are mainly dependent on specific days in the year. This includes all weekends and public holidays such as New Year’s Eve.
H2 – The Hotel prices are mainly dependent on its location such as in metro city or rather at a tourist destination. 
H3 – The Hotel prices are mainly dependent on the kind of facilities it provides to the customers.

To prove each of the above Hypothesis, I worked on different models while using linear regression to obtain the relationship with Hotel room rent.

#Conclusion
The following factors were responsible for an increase in Hotel room rents in decreasing order of priority:
1.	Star Rating of the Hotel (Generally 4 star and 5 star hotels are expensive)
2.	It is a special day such as New Year’s Eve
3.	The Hotel has a swimming pool
4.	The Hotel is located at a tourist destination
5.	The Hotel is near to Airport
6.	The Hotel is situated in a Metro city
